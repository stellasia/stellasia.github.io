I enjoyed the practical examples with React and GraphQL and the section about spatial analysis goes in incredible detail. I\u2019m not much into machine learning but the chapter about it definitely sparked my interest and also the relationship prediction one draw my attention - so whether your a pro or a newcomer as long as you love graphs you will find the right chapter. - Also, If you are using javascript you\u2019ll find handy this open source npm package to build cypher queries: fluent-cypher."},

For those who are dealing with real scenarios for graphs like Knowledge System (my case), this book gives many insights on how to tackle some graph challenges, especially exploring them through different approaches, such as using machine learning libraries already established in the Data Science community, coding python graph algorithms step-by-step, and sure enough using Neo4j Graph Data Science resources. In general, the book goes beyond the tasks related to graph analytics, since the book moves well from the duties of data engineering, analytics and data science itself, as well as operational application architecture. - WHAT I LIKE: From the chapter 6th until the 11th the book has a really insighful coverage for the most relevant Graph-based Machine Learning algorithms and approaches using quite interesting use-cases. The book goes further, covering even more advanced Deep Learning models atop graph algorithms. - WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE: Since the book quite properly addresses some Deep Learning capabilities, it would be very important that it could also bring a scenario of high data scale, and for these cases the setup of the Neo4j environment becomes a very sensitive subject. That said, I miss more information about the Neo4j distributed storage capacities and partitioning rules of the model (sharding, multi-db, multi-tenancy) for scenarios of hundreds of thousands of nodes or even billions."},

If you are looking for a guide on building your first end-to-end application with Neo4j graph database and its Graph Data Science library, this is a great choice. Yes, you\u2019ll get a good introduction into graph analytics and graph algorithms. But what is just as important for getting things done is that you\u2019ll get a good introduction to the whole workflow from raw data through ingestion and analytics to final results and visualisations. All that with concrete examples and code. I find this highly valuable. - As a data scientist, I especially appreciate Section 2 (graph algorithms) and I get excited with Section 3 (Machine Learning on graphs). All is well explained and discussed, there are fundamental basics with practical examples and even code implementations - and of course, examples using the GDS library. I would appreciate more detailed technical discussions and evaluations of graph algorithms, but truth be told, that would be well out of scope of a single book. - Altogether I'd recommend this to anyone exploring graph analytics and ways to find additional value in connected data. And it even provides a good introduction into graph-based ML, such as nice explanation of graph neural networks. I hope Estelle is not done writing:)"},

Of particular interest to me is how to set-up a solid data science project for using graph-based features in machine learning. In addition, Chapter 10 leads me through the principles on graph embedding and how I can work with them and utilize their features in Neo4j. Thanks Estelle, this will be a valuable reference for me going forward in my projects."}
