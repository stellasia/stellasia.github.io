For those who are dealing with real scenarios for graphs like Knowledge System (my case), this book gives many insights on how to tackle some graph challenges, especially exploring them through different approaches, such as using machine learning libraries already established in the Data Science community, coding python graph algorithms step-by-step, and sure enough using Neo4j Graph Data Science resources. In general, the book goes beyond the tasks related to graph analytics, since the book moves well from the duties of data engineering, analytics and data science itself, as well as operational application architecture. - WHAT I LIKE: From the chapter 6th until the 11th the book has a really insighful coverage for the most relevant Graph-based Machine Learning algorithms and approaches using quite interesting use-cases. The book goes further, covering even more advanced Deep Learning models atop graph algorithms. - WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE: Since the book quite properly addresses some Deep Learning capabilities, it would be very important that it could also bring a scenario of high data scale, and for these cases the setup of the Neo4j environment becomes a very sensitive subject. That said, I miss more information about the Neo4j distributed storage capacities and partitioning rules of the model (sharding, multi-db, multi-tenancy) for scenarios of hundreds of thousands of nodes or even billions."},

All is well explained and discussed, there are fundamental basics with practical examples and even code implementations - and of course, examples using the GDS library. I would appreciate more detailed technical discussions and evaluations of graph algorithms, but truth be told, that would be well out of scope of a single book. - Altogether I'd recommend this to anyone exploring graph analytics and ways to find additional value in connected data.

It is a practical guide written by someone who is well grounded in theory. The author's experience as a data scientist helps her bring together various tools in the Neo4j ecosystem that you might use on a real project. You aren't just getting a single vendor's sales pitch. Sometimes data scientists struggle with the ML Ops required to turn a great model into a production tool. The book takes the reader all the way through ideas for deploying graph analytics in an application and tuning the database in production. This sets the book apart from others that I have read on applied graph analytics. - The section on spatial data is especially well done, as the author has been a major contributor to the Neo4j community in that area. The chapters on machine learning are also deep and valuable. - In order to explain graph algorithms, the book provides examples in pure Python before showing the way to call Neo4j's implementation. I found myself skimming/skipping the pure Python explanations since Neo4j provides these algorithms out of the box. - The book attempts to explain concepts from the ground up, but you will get more from this book if you have some experience with machine learning, Neo4j, and Python. For a data scientist or analyst looking to add to graph analytics to your tool kit, this will be a valuable resource and a source of inspiration."},
