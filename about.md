# Summary

I have completed a PhD in particle physics in 2014 during which I was part of the exciting ATLAS experiment at **CERN**. Analyzing *billions of data events*, we were able to show the existence of a long searched particle, the Higgs boson. Its discovery leads to the [2013 Nobel prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/summary/) for the theoreticians who predicted the existence of this particle.

After this PhD, I decided to leave academia to explore diverse fields, still through **data analysis** and **mathematical modelisation** that helps solve real-life problems.

I am interested in many topics, with a strong belief in "fair machine learning" and "responsible data science". In my opinion, it goes through teaching and explaining to all the involved people what can and can't be done with data, and what a model result really is, taking into account its **uncertainties**. 

Beside data analysis, I can also write reliable code (including webservices and HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that can be pushed to **production**.

<p>Right now, I am mainly interested in:
    <ul>
		<li>mathematical/statistical modelisation</li>
		<li>bayesian analysis and its applications</li>
        <li>graph database (neo4j for instance) and graphs in general</li>
	</ul>
