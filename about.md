# Summary

I have completed a PhD in particle physics in 2014 during which I was part of the exciting ATLAS experiment at **CERN**. Analyzing *billions of data events*, we were able to show the existence of a long searched particle, the Higgs boson. Its discovery leads to the [2013 Nobel prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/summary/) for the theoreticians who predicted the existence of this particle.

After this PhD, I decided to leave academia to explore diverse fields, still through **data analysis** and **mathematical modeling** that helps solve real-life problems.

I am interested in many topics, with a strong belief in "fair machine learning" and "responsible data science". In my opinion, it goes through teaching and explaining to all the involved people what can and can't be done with data, and what a model result really is, taking into account its **uncertainties**. 

Beside data analysis, I can also write reliable code (including webservices and HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that can be pushed to **production**.

<div class="info">
<p>Right now, I am mainly interested in topics including but not limited to:
    <ul>
        <li>graph data and algorithms to extract meaningful information from it</li>
	<li>mathematical/statistical modeling</li>
	<li>bayesian analysis and its applications</li>
    </ul>

# Tools

- **Data science & machine learning**: python data analysis toolkit ie: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn
    - Create the model (mathematical formulation)
    - Implementation (efficient code)
    - Validation with simulations (Monte-Carlo techniques)
    - Visualization (including maps)

- **Graph data analysis**:
    - Neo4j graph database (certified): create the data model that best suits your use-case
	- Graph algorithms: extract information from your graph data
	- Machine learning on graphs: apply machine learning predictive methods on graph data (graph embeddings...)


- **Web development**: django, HTML, CSS, JS; webservices (RPC, REST, GraphQL)

- **Database**: SQL (Postgresql, Postgis), graph databases (Neo4j, arangoDB)

- Development: python (pytest, sphinx), ReactJS. I also have some experience with C++ and Java.

- Linux (some server management with ansible), git (gitlab)

- Cloud: AWS (S3), Google Cloud (Google App Engine)
