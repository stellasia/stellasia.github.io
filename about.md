# Summary

I have completed a PhD in particle physics in 2014 during which I was part of the exciting ATLAS experiment at **CERN**. Analyzing *billions of data events*, we were able to show the existence of a long searched particle, the Higgs boson. Its discovery leads to the [2013 Nobel prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2013/summary/) for the theoreticians who predicted the existence of this particle.

After this PhD, I decided to leave academia to explore diverse fields, still through **data analysis** and **mathematical modelisation** that helps solve real-life problems.

I am interested in many topics, with a strong belief in "fair machine learning" and "responsible data science". In my opinion, it goes through teaching and explaining to all the involved people what we can and can't do with data, and what a model result really is, taking into account its **uncertainties**. 

Beside data analysis, I can also write reliable code (including webservices and HTML/CSS/JavaScript) that can be pushed to **production**.

# Tools

- **Data science**: python data analysis toolkit ie: numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Database**: SQL (Postgresql, Postgis)
- **Web development**: django, HTML, CSS, JS; webservices (RPC, REST)
- Development: python (pytest), C++
- Linux (some server management), git (gitlab)



# Experience

- _2018-_ : **Senior Data Scientist** at Motion-S (www.motion-s.com/) (Luxembourg): telematic data exploration


- _2014-2018_ : **Data Scientist** at effiCity (www.efficity.com/) (working remotely, France):
    - Real estate estimation algorithm:
	    - Mathematical formulation with parameter fitting on real data
		- Implementation with the  **python** stack (numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn)
		- Validation with simulations
		- Push to production (create appropriate python package)!
	- Statistics:
	    - Regression algorithm (KNN)
		- Function minimization (scipy)
	    - Clustering to identify cities with similar caracteristics
	- As always, internal note and code documentation
    - Discussion with field professionals to improve the model
	- Even if not my main skill, I also participated in the team projects especially the front-end development (django), including CSS integration and JS scripts in some occasions

- _2011-2014_: **PhD** in Particle physics (LAL, Orsay, France)
    - Search for the Higgs boson and, after its discovery, measurement of some properties (called _couplings_)
	- Hypothesis testing (likelihood) and best parameter estimation with the [C++ ROOT](//root.cern.ch) framework
	- Analyze billions of events on distributed data analysis system (Big data)
