I want to start a serie of post on a weekly periodicity basis, where I would try to hightlight things I have learned/achieved, or just things I was impressed about, during the past week(s).

Let's start today by the things that have been done since the begining of November.


# Graphs graphs graphs

This week and the week before I have been writting an algorithm using graphs! The problem was to order LINESTRING segments reprenting a  bus path. Segments were  unordered and undirected. To do so, I have created a graph where nodes are made of both the stops and the segments boundaries. Then I have build a path reconstruction algorithm based on nodes matching, giving higher probabilities to right turns compared to left turns (ie edges orientation are important too). It's working pretty well! Maybe a future post will be dedicated to this topic.


# Conferences

I discovered some interesting conferences/lectures to be given in the more or less close future:

- [Forum Emploi Maths](https://www.forum-emploi-maths.org/) to be held in Paris on december 13th.
- [Network Analysis, Inference, and Modeling NAIM 2019 ](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/ecas/632-home/), in Frejus (France) in 2019.


# Fun

I cam accross these pictures again during the last week about correlation:

- An illustration from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/552/):

- A list of [spurious correlations](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations), for instance:
