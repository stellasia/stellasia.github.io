## Detailed table of content

###  Section 1: Graph data modeling with Neo4j

- **Chapter 1: Graph Databases**

Discover or rediscover the principles of graph databases through the main concepts of graph theory - node, edges, directed and undirected graphs...

- **Chapter 2: The Cypher Query Language**

Make sure you know how to insert and retrieve data into and from Neo4j. Cypher is a powerful and visual graph query language you will get familiar with and love very quickly.

- **Chapter 3: Empowering your Business with Pure Cypher (a.k.a. Building and Using Knowledge Graphs)**

Use knowledge graphs like a pro! Build a KG from any data source, including Wikidata and NLP, and build powerful queries thanks to this graph structure.


### Section 2: Graph Algorithms

Learn what are the main algorithms you can run on a graph structure and what kind of information can be extracted from it. Information will become feature for Machine Learning models in the following section. In each of the chapters dedicated to one particular type of algorithm, one algorithm will be detailed, from mathematical formulation to a simple implementation (using Python) so that you can fully visualize how it works.

- **Chapter 4: The Graph Data Science Library (GDS) and Path Finding**

Call your first procedure from the awesome GDS library, a Neo4j plugin for data scientists. As a first example, you will use shortest path finding algorithm, but much more is coming in the following chapters. The Djiskra algorithm for shortest path is detailed.

- **Chapter 5: Spatial Data**

To continue on your exploration of path finding algorithms, you will import spatial data (geojson, shapefile) into Neo4j, write spatial queries (distance, intersection) and finally, build a real routing engine. This will be done using both the GDS and the neo4j-spatial plugin. You will display the results of your routing method in a browser with JavaScript and the leaflet library.

- **Chapter 6: Node Importance**

Going back to graph algorithms, you will measure node importance, with different metrics depending on how you define importance for your data. In this chapter, the PageRank algorithm is analyzed.

- **Chapter 7: Community Detection and Similarity Measures**

Create densely connected clusters of nodes in your graph to identify communities. This chapter gives comprehensive details about the Label Propagation and Louvain algorithms.

### Section 3: Machine Learning on Graphs

- **Chapter 8: Using Graph-based Features in Machine Learning**

Build a node classification pipeline using "classical" features and features extracted from graph algorithms. Automatically extract all features from Neo4j thanks to the Neo4j Python driver and create a pandas DataFrame ready for a scikit-learn pipeline.

- **Chapter 9: Predicting Relationships**

Turn a real graph problem - predicting future or missing relationships - into a Machine Learning problem. Implement and solve it using Python and its Data Science stack.

- **Chapter 10: Graph Embedding: from Graphs to Matrices**

Run a node embedding algorithm from the GDS, without extracting data for another framework.


### Section 4: Neo4j for Production

- **Chapter 11: Using Neo4J in your Web Application**

Build a web application using Neo4j as a database in two ways: either with a Flask backend, or building a JavaScript GraphQL backend and a React front-end application thanks to the all-in-one GRAND stack.

- **Chapter 12: Neo4j At Scale**
    Finally, configure Neo4j for sharding to deal with really big data (an introduction).
